# Shopify Node.js x Express.js x React.js Boilerplate

[![Shopify Course](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kinngh/extras/main/shopify_course_promo_github.png)](https://kinngh.gumroad.com/l/how-to-make-shopify-apps?offer_code=PREORDER)

An embedded app starter template to get up and ready with Shopify app development with JavaScript. This is heavily influenced by the choices Shopify Engineering team made in building their [starter template](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-node) to ensure smooth transition between templates.

I've included [notes](/docs/NOTES.md) on this repo which goes over the repo on why certain choices were made.

I also did make a video going over the entire repo as of November 4, 2022. If there's any substantial changes, the video here will be updated to reflect it.

## Supporting repositories

- NEW! [Next.js + Prisma](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-nextjs-prisma-app): A Shopify app boilerplate built with Next.js and Prisma ORM, with deployments available on Vercel.
- [WIP] [`npx create-shop-app@latest`](https://github.com/kinngh/create-shop-app): A CLI tool to generate embedded Shopify app boilerplate with a tech stack of your own.

## Tech Stack

- React.js
  - `raviger` for routing.
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Vite
- Ngrok
- Apollo/Client

## Why I made this

The Shopify CLI generates an amazing starter app but it still needs some more boilerplate code and customizations so I can jump on to building apps with a simple clone. This includes:

- MongoDB based session and database management.
- Monetization (recurring subscriptions) ready to go.
- Webhooks isolated and setup.
- React routing taken care of (I miss Next.js mostly because of routing and under the hood improvements).
- Misc boilerplate code and templates to quickly setup inApp subscriptions, routes, webhooks and more.

## Notes

### Setup

- Refer to [SETUP](/docs/SETUP.md)

### Misc

- Storing data is kept to a minimal to allow building custom models for flexibility.
  - Session persistence is also kept to a minimal and based on the Redis example provided by Shopify, but feel free to modify as required.
